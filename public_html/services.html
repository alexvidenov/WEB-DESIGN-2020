                       We offer complete diagnostics and repair of your old battery for an electric bicycle.
                       We make a new package with new cells and electronics the size of the old box, keeping the mechanical construction in its original form.
                       You get a battery with cells and electronics of the next generation and most often the bike performs better than the same as a new one. The new battery has a standard two-year warranty on our products.
